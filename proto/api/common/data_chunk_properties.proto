/**
 * Metadata defines all possible metadata for objects.
 * For example, for stream of dataChunks, is used to represent:
 *   - chunk header,
 *   - data descriptions,
 *   - data encoding descriptions,
 *   - etc.
 * Can also be used as metadata description for any other objects.
 * Since protobuf has ability not to send 'optional' fields, metadata can have full set of fields, describing
 * all possible metadata options and have only few of them which are really used sent to the correspondent.
